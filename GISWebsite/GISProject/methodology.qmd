# Dataset Used

Derna_city_250m hexagon provided.

Roads, buildings and places of interest data (labelled as POIS) from OpenStreetMap (OSM) data sets, downloaded from [Libya](https://download.geofabrik.de/africa/libya.html) which is located in the Geofabrik download server

Health facilities, elevation model and flood impact assessment downloaded from [Libya Floods](https://data.humdata.org/event/f1c3a777-4079-49fb-9d64-12a72f46f1e3) which is located in the Humanitarian Data Exchange

Geo Eye satellite images for Libya, downloaded from [Libya Floods](https://www.maxar.com/open-data/libya-floods-0923) which is located in the Maxar Open Data Program.

# Accessibility Analysis

1. Extract motor vehicle road network.

2. Create 3 hexagon layers: Hexagon base, Accessibility for Before Flood, and Accessibility for After Flood.

3. Generate hexagon centroids to calculate the distances between hexagon centroids and hospitals with the Origin-Destination Matrix Tool.

4. Extracting shortest distance pairs using SQL in DB Manager.

5. Map accessibility values of hospitals.

6. Generate choropleth maps for both Before and After hexagons.

# Suitability Analysis
1. Generate proximity maps for each by converting vector data to raster data.

2. Generate ranking models for each feature.

3. Carry out an AHP Analysis to obtain the importance of each feature.

4. Combine different ranking maps into one output, using the weightages from the AHP Analysis, and multiplying them to their respective features using the Raster Calculator.

5. From the resulting output, we classify the suitability factor by using Reclassification by Table.

6. We identified 3 as the minimum level for an area to be considered "Suitable".
